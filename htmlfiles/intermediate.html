        UNIVERSE

The Universe is "Everything'.It icludes all  of space and matter and energy that space contain.It even include time itself and of course you and me along with all the celestial bodies.

NOTE:"Matter" is somthing that occupy space and can be weighed.
     "Energy" is ability to do work i.e. ability to exert force to cause                       

The Universe we see is known as "Observable Universe"( the Universe we have know so far about) as we dont know the limit of Universe till now.

About 13.7 billons years ago ,  Observable Universe  begin with space with extremely high temperature and pressure  which after continous contraction in space-time reached it's limit  and an explosion took place is known as "BIG-BANG". 
                              After explosion formation of first galaxy ,star and planet started and later the journey continued which we now see as a enormous "Observable Universe".
                                            The size of Observable Universe is approximately 28 billion Year in diameter(across).

NOTE: 1 Light Year = 9.5 Trillion km i.e. the amount of distance 
      travlled light ( with speed of 3lakh km/seconds )in one year. 


GALAXY

A Galaxy is a huge collection of gas, dust, planets ,other celestial bodies i.e. billions of stars and their solar systems, all held together by gravity.
                    Galaxy is usually of 4 main types :Spiral , Elliptical ,Peculiar , Irregular.
                                  We live on a planet called Earth that is part of our solar system. But where is our solar system? It's a small part of the our "MILKYWAY" Galaxy.It is Spiral type Galaxy.
                      
Our Galaxy is approximately 13.6 billions years old. It's  disk's diameter is approximately 100,000 light years and thickness is approximately 1,000 light years.
                                 Our closest neighbouring Galaxy is "ANDROMEDA". It is also a Spiral type Galaxy .It is 2.5 million light years away from our galaxy (MILKYWAY). 

There are many celestial bodies spreaded randomly throughout the space which are quite big , hot , bright , mysterious ,etc. but there is one among all of them is very mysterious and often considered as "Scary one " i.e. BLACK HOLES.

BLACK HOLES 

The idea of an object in space so massive and dense that light could not escape it .
                They were predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity, which showed that when a massive star dies, it leaves behind a small, dense remnant core that passes through several stages to become a "Black Hole".
                          Black Holes are the only singlr that are usually massive in size .Infact the largest single body in whole Observable Universe is a Black Holes namely "TON 618".
                                                      TON 618 has 390 billions km in diameter. There are many more like it but smaller in sizes.  
      For a Star to become a Black Hole it must atleast have five times the mass of the Sun (i.e. approximately  1.989 X 10^30 kg).

Yes ,Stars are also of differents types depending upon the stage of life of star i.e. how old is the star .

1. Red Dwarfs :  A Red Dwarf is the smallest and coolest kind of star on the main sequence. Red dwarfs are by far the most common type of star in the Milky Way, at least in the neighborhood of the Sun.
For Eg. "Proxima Centauri" nearesrt star to thr sun which a Red Dwarf and is 4.2 light years far away from Sun.
                                          It's surface temperature varies from 2,000 to 4,000 K and weighs approximately 0.6 to 0.8 Solar Mass ( 1 Solar Mass is mass of the Sun i.e. 2 X 10^30 kg) .

2. White Dwarfs : A white dwarf is very dense : its mass is comparable to the Sun's, while its volume is comparable to the Earth's. The nearest known white dwarf is "Sirius B" , at 8.6 light years away from Sun .
      It's surface temperature varies from 8,000 to 40, 000 K and weighs approximately 8 to 10.5 Solar Mases. 

3. Yellow Dwarf : They are also know as "G type-Stars" . Sun is G- type Star / Yellow Dwarf . 
                     Such a Star weighs approximately 0.9 to 1.1 Solar Masses and an effective temperature between about 5,300 and 6,000 K .

4. Blue Dwarfs : They are also called "B type-Star" . They exists theoretically i.e. there existense has not been proved or found yet. 

These stars have from 2 to 16 times the mass of the Sun and surface temperatures between 10,000 and 30,000 K. B-type stars are extremely luminous and blue. 

5. Brown Dwarf : They are also called "Failed Stars".They are more massive than the most massive gas giant planets but massive enough to 
produce it's own energy.
                         In fact, most astronomers would classify any object with between 15 times the mass of Jupiter and 75 times the mass of Jupiter to be a Brown Dwarf.

6. Black Dwarf : A Black Dwarf is a theoretical stellar remnant, specifically a white dwarf that has cooled sufficiently to no longer emit significant heat or light. 
                                 The time required for a white dwarf to reach this state is calculated to be longer than the current age of the universe (13.8 billion years), no black dwarfs are expected to exist in the universe at the present time. It's mass is hypothetically assumed to be around 0.07 Solar Masses. 

7. Red Gaint : A red giant is a luminous giant star. The outer atmosphere is inflated and tenuous, making the radius large.  
 
It's mass is around 0.3 to 8 Solar Masses and temeperature reaches upto 5,000 K.

10. Supergaints : Supergiants are among the most massive and most luminous stars.
               The temperature range of supergiant stars spans from about 3,400 K to over 20,000 K.
                               Supergiants have masses from 8 to 12 Solar Masses, and luminosities from about 1,000 to over a million times the Sun. They vary greatly in radius, usually from 30 to 500, or even in excess of 1,000 Solar Radii ( 1 Solar Radii = 695,700 km ).

9. Neutron Star : A Neutron Star is the collapsed core of a massive supergiant star, which had a total mass of between 10 and 25 Solar Masses .
        Except for Black Holes, neutron stars are the smallest and densest known class of " Stellar Objects ". Neutron stars have a radius on the order of 10 kilometers (6 mi) and a mass of about 1.4 Solar Masses . They result from the  "SUPERNOVA Explosion" of a massive star, combined with "Gravitational Collapse", that compresses the core past White Dwarf density to that of atomic nuclei. 
                                                   Once formed, neutron stars no longer actively generate heat and cool over time.  

NOTE : " Stellar Object " is an Astronomical object, Celestial Object or Heavenly Body is a naturally occurring physical entity, association, or structure that exists within the Observable Universe .

NOTE : " Gravitational Collapse " is the contraction of an Astronomical object due to the influence of its own Gravity, which tends to draw matter inward toward the center of Gravity.
                                                         Gravitational collapse is a fundamental mechanism for structure formation in the universe. 

10. Pulsar : A Pulsar (from pulsating radio source) is a highly magnetized rotating Neutron Star that emits beams of Electromagnetic Radiation out of its Magnetic Poles. 
                                     This Radiation can be observed only when a beam of emission is pointing toward Earth (similar to the way a lighthouse can be seen only when the light is pointed in the direction of an observer), and is responsible for the pulsed appearance of emission. 

NOTE : Electromagnetic Radiation from Radio Waves to Gamma Waves.  

11. Magnetars :  A Magnetar is an exotic type of Neutron Star, its defining feature that it has an ultra-powerful magnetic field.

The field is about 1,000 times stronger than a normal Neutron Star and about a trillion times stronger than the Earth's. Magnetars are, by far, the most magnetic stars in the  Observable Universe. 

12. Quasars : A Quasar is an extremely luminous "Active Galactic Nucleus"(AGN). It is sometimes known as a Quasi-Stellar Object (QSO).

Quasars inhabit the centers of active galaxies and are among the most powerful and energetic objects known in the  Observable Universe, emitting up to a thousand times the energy output of the Milky Way, which contains 200–400 billion Stars.
                       The emission from an AGN is powered by a  "Supermassive Black Hole" with a mass ranging from millions to tens of billions of Solar Masses.

NOTE : AGN or An active Galactic Nucleus is a compact region at the center of a galaxy that emits a massive amount of energy.  They most luminous persistent sources of electromagnetic radiation in the  Observable Universe .

TYPES OF STELLAR EXPLOSION THAT LEADS TO FOMATION OF SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF  STELLAR ENTITIES : 

1. Micronova : A Micronova is a type of thermonuclear explosion on the surface of a white dwarf much smaller than the strength of a Nova , about a millionth that of a typical Nova.

2. Nova : A Nova is an explosion from the surface of a White-Dwarf Star in a binary star system ( two stars revolving each other). 

A Nova occurs when the White Dwarf, which is the dense core of a once-normal Star, “steals” gas from its nearby companion star. When enough gas builts up on the surface of the white dwarf it triggers an explosion. For a brief time, the system can shine up to a million times brighter than normal.
                                                  As long as it continues to take gas from its companion star, the White Dwarf can produce Nova outbursts at regular intervals. 

3. Kilonova : An explosion resulting from the merging of two neutron stars, or a neutron star and a black hole into single entity . These events are extremely energetic, and can release as much energy in a few seconds as our Sun will produce in its entire 10-billion-year lifetime. 
                       These mergers are thought to produce gamma-ray bursts and emit bright electromagnetic radiation, called "Kilonovae".

4. Supernova :  A Supernova is a violent Stellar Explosion that can shine as brightly as an entire Galaxy of billions of normal Stars. 

It is catergorized into two parts : Type I , Type II .

a) Type I  : Type I Supernovae most likely form as a White Dwarf “steals” hot gas from a companion Star. If enough gas piles up on the surface of the white dwarf, a runaway thermonuclear explosion blasts the star to bits, leaving nothing behind. These are the brightest Supernovae, and can be used to measure the distances to other Galaxies.

b) Type II : Type II Supernovae are the final stage in the evolution of stars that are at least eight times as massive as the Sun.

Such a Star reaches a point where it can no longer produce nuclear energy in its core. Without the outward pressure created by this energy, gravity wins out and causes the Star’s core to collapse to form a neutron star or Black Hole. 

5. Hypernova : A Hypernova (also known as a Collapsar) is a very energetic Supernova which is believed to result from an extreme core-collapse scenario.  
                     A massive Star (>30 solar masses) collapses to form a rotating black hole emitting twin astrophysical jets and surrounded by an accretion disk.
                                 It is a type of Stellar Explosion that ejects material with an unusually high kinetic energy, an order of magnitude higher than most Supernovae, with a luminosity at least 10 times greater.
                  Hypernovae are one of the mechanisms for producing long " Gamma Ray Bursts "(GRBs), which range from 2 seconds to over a minute in duration.

6. Gamma Ray Burst : Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are immensely energetic explosions that have been observed in distant galaxies, described by NASA as "the most powerful class of explosions in the  Observable Universe".
           They are the most energetic and luminous electromagnetic events since the BIG-BANG.
                           Bursts can last from ten milliseconds to several hours.[3][4] After an initial flash of gamma rays, a longer-lived "afterglow" is usually emitted at longer wavelengths (X-ray, ultraviolet, optical, infrared, microwave and radio).
                                                      The sources of most GRBs are billions of light years away from Earth, implying that the explosions are both extremely energetic (a typical burst releases as much energy in a few seconds as the Sun will in its entire 10-billion-year lifetime) and extremely rare (a few per galaxy per million years).

7. BIG-BANG : The Big Bang event is a physical theory that describes how the  Observable Universe expanded from an initial state of high density and temperature.
                         Cosmic Inflation, Cosmological Inflation, or just Inflation, is a theory of exponential expansion of space in the early universe. The extremely rapid expansion is believed to have lasted from 10^36 seconds to between 10^33 and 10^32 seconds after the BIG-BANG.

 The  Observable  Universe  continued   to  expand, but at a slower rate. The acceleration  of  this  expansion  due  to  "DARK ENERGY" began  after  the Observable Universe  was  already  over  7.7 billion  years  old (5.4 billion years ago).
